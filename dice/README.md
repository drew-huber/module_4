# LEARNING ACTIVITY: THE DICE CLASS
In this activity we will learn how to create and use our own data type. To 
learn how to create a programmer-defined data type we will create the Dice class. 
Once we have created this new data type, we will create objects of type
Dice and use them.

There are videos that demonstrate how to create and use programmer-defined
 data types.
It is recommended that you write the code as you follow along with the video.

We will be writing code in the main.cpp, dice.h, and dice.cpp files. They
 can be found in the src folder.
